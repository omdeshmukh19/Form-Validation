JavaScript Form Validation Project:

Forms are an integral part of our Website. We need to verify all the details so we know
the person filling the form is Human and not a Bot.

Required Fields:
1. Full Name, Email ID, Phone Number, Password and Confirm Password
Validation Criteria:
2.Name must not be less than 5 characters
3.Email Id should have @ character in it
4.Phone Number should not be 123456789 and must be a 10-digit number.
5.Password cannot be ‘password’ or ‘name of the user’ or less than 8 characters.
6.Password and confirm password should match
7.Whenever any of the above are not met, the error should pop saying ex; “enter
correct email” or “password is not strong” etc
8.You can include more conditions and fields to the form validation but the above
are mandatory.
Must use the following for development:
1.HTML

3.JavaScript( Event listeners(onSubmit and onChange), multiple functions, loops,
if/else ).
